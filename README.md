Stuff for the very much more effective wasting of time on Imgur

This Python 3 script shows you the images on the imgur.com site in a slide show kinda way. 
It scrolls down the page slowly, opens up the extra images where apropriate. 
It pauses over the comments. It even has a go at delaying moving on for animated GIFs.

Instructions:

Download all this lots into a folder named 'imgur' in your Documents folder in your home folder. 
Or stick it wherever you like and change the script, choice is yours, I'm not the boss of you :)

Run

python3 imgur.py

Or 

python3 imgur.py -opt 

if you want to change which part of Imgur you want to browse or you want to change the timing of the images.
